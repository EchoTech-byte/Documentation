Project Overview 
• Project Title: EcoTech 
• Start Date: November 11 2024
• End Date: December 2 2024
• Project Type: Website Application 
• Status: Completed

1.1 Project Summary 
The "Eco-Tech" is a technology initiative that can identify natural hazards that may fall, which in this case are trees. In this regard, the project remains constructed as a real-time hazard map that preserves the natural environment while making sure that people are safe in this condition. It may prevent accidents, property damage, and damage to ecosystems. 

1.2 Project Objectives

Superordinate Objective
To identify and mark the hazardous trees within the campus of Northern Bukidnon State College so that no hazard could yet occur and the people within the community would be safe.

Subordinate Objectives

1. A mapping of the hazardous trees to ensure the safety of students, staff and faculty members.

2. Pre-management and monitoring of the surroundings of the campus.

3. A tool for awareness in a technological-environmental sense for decision facilitation.

2.1 Outputs

1. Clickable Map

Is a clickable computer-generated map that clearly distinguishes where all campus trees are.
Hazardous trees are colored and/or have marked icons for easy identification purposes.
It has built-in functionalities including GPS so to ensure proper tree positioning and navigate in the campus. The application is also mobile-enabled and accessible by any app or browser interface.
Conclusion of Search Functionality and Tree Pictures

A search bar will be included so that targeted trees can be found by name, species, or hazard level.

Each tree in the system will include a detailed profile including the following:
.A clear picture of the tree to identify the tree.
Key data such as species, age, condition, and any issues like dead branches or trunk leaning.
Recommended actions such as pruning, removal, or monitoring.

2. Project Scope

2.1 Deliverables

1. Interactive Map

Description:

A simple-to-use digital map that visually indicates the location of all trees in the campus.
Trees considered hazardous are highlighted using a unique color or icon for quick identification.

Users can click on individual tree locations to display information including type, condition, and level of hazard.

It will have built-in GPS for accurate location of the tree and navigation through the campus.

Mobile friendly and can be accessed from any browser or app interface.

2. Search Functionality and Tree Pictures

Search bar with the ability to search for specific trees by name, species, or hazard level
Each tree in the system will have a detailed profile which will include:
A clear picture of the tree for easy identification
Key data such as tree species, age, condition, and any observed issues (e.g., dead branches, leaning trunk).
